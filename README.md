# Sum-of-Squares-Problem
Write a program that adds up the squares of integers starting from a lower limit L, input by the user.  The program should use at least 4 numbers and the sum of squares of integers should be at least 100.  For example if L is 10 then: sum of squares = 2*2 + 3*3 + 4*4 + 5*5 +6*6 + 7*7 (now we can stop adding the series because we have considered at least 4 numbers and the sum of squares of integers is at least 100). if the user inputs 9 then sum of squares = 9*9+10*10+11*11+12*12  (we can stop now as at least 4 numbers have been used and the sum is at least 100).
